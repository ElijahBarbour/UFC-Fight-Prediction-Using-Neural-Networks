# [UFC Fight Prediciton Using Neural Networks](https://share.streamlit.io/elijahbarbour/ufc-fight-prediction-using-neural-networks/primary_page.py)

This project is somewhat a continuation of my first project, [UFC Fight Prediciton Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/ElijahBarbour/UFC-Fight-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning), but is slightly different. This project constructs a Multi-Layer Neural Network Model in order to predict the winners of UFC Fights.
